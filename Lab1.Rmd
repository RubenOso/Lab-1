Task 1

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

```{r Task 1 }
getwd()

```

Task 2

```{r Task 2 }

ddt <- read.csv("DDT.csv")
head(ddt)
```
Task 3

The qualitative variables in ddt are river and species.

The quantitative variables in ddt are mile, length, weight, and DDT.

Theres 3 types of species in the dataset which are CCATFISH, LMBASS, SMBUFFALO
```{r Task 3 }

# LMBASS with WEIGHT > 800
subset(ddt, SPECIES == "LMBASS" & WEIGHT > 800)

# RIVER is SCM and DDT > 4.0
subset(ddt, RIVER == "SCM" & DDT > 4.0)

```

Task 4
 
Q1
```{r}
mean_length <- mean(ddt$LENGTH, na.rm = TRUE)
mean_length




```

Q2

```{r}
sd_weight <- sd(ddt$WEIGHT, na.rm = TRUE)
round(sd_weight, 2)
```


Q3

```{r}
plot(LENGTH ~ WEIGHT, data = ddt, col = "red")

```


Answer: 0

Q4

```{r}

v <- 1:20
tail(v/20, 1)   

```


TASK 5 

```{r}
## Task 5 — tables and barplots



# 1) Table of rivers
river_tab <- table(ddt$RIVER)

# 2) Color-coded barplot of rivers
barplot(
  river_tab,
  col = rainbow(length(river_tab)),
  main = "Fish counts by River",
  xlab = "River",
  ylab = "Count"
)

# 3) Table of rivers crossed with species
riv_species <- table(ddt$RIVER, ddt$SPECIES)   # rows: RIVER, cols: SPECIES
riv_species

# 4) Barplot of rivers crossed with species (grouped bars + legend)
cols <- rainbow(nrow(riv_species))
barplot(
  riv_species,
  beside = TRUE,                 # grouped bars (set FALSE for stacked)

legend("topright", legend = rownames(riv_species), fill = cols, bty = "n", cex = 0.8)

```

TASK 6

```{r}
pie(table(ddt$SPECIES), main = "Fish Species")

pie(table(ddt$RIVER), main = "Rivers")


```


TASK 7

```{r}
## Task 7 — Boxplot of DDT
boxplot(ddt$DDT, main = "DDT", ylab = "DDT")

## Task 7 — Boxplot of WEIGHT
boxplot(ddt$WEIGHT, main = "WEIGHT", ylab = "WEIGHT")

## Task 7 — Boxplot of LENGTH
boxplot(ddt$LENGTH, main = "LENGTH", ylab = "LENGTH")

```


Task 8

```{r}

       data = ddt,
       number = 1, overlap = 0,

       number = 1, overlap = 0,
       xlab = "WEIGHT", ylab = "DDT",
       main = "DDT vs WEIGHT by SPECIES")


```


TASK 9

```{r}

ggplot(ddt, aes(x = SPECIES, y = WEIGHT, fill = RIVER)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
